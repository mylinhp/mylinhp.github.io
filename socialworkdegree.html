  <h1 class="hero-text">SocialWorkDegree Case Study</h1>
</div>

<div class="fixed-width p-5">
<h1 class="casestudy">Project</h1>
<p>Optimal creates data-driven web content with the mission of empowering users to make informed decisions about their careers and education. It solves the pain of not understanding the cost and earning potential for different schools by providing student reviews and college rankings for every major based on annual tuition and alumni salaries.</p>

<h1 class="casestudy">Challenge</h1>
<p>Optimal’s current products cover the breadth of education by providing information on every degree, but some degrees require more in-depth information that cannot be addressed well on current products. People are searching for social work degrees, but existing resources are outdated, not trustworthy, and not comprehensive.</p>

<h1 class="casestudy">Solution</h1>
<p>I was tasked as a Product Manager to tackle this problem. This case study walks through my solution by developing SocialWorkDegree.org, a specialized website about social work degree programs and careers.</p>

<h1 class="casestudy">Approach</h1>
<h2>Discovery and Research - Keyword Research</h2>
<p>In order to understand the full landscape of what people search for related to this topic, I used Ahrefs and SEMrush to compile a list of KW’s with high SV (search volume) and discovered what type of content was ranking.</p>
<h2>Discovery and Research - Competitor Analysis</h2>
<p>I conducted competitor research by comparing a number of similar sites. This allowed me to focus on identifying what unique value our competitors are offering and where there may be a gap for us to fill." I recognized that SocialWorkDegree had an opportunity to stand up by creating state specific ranking lists for BSW’s and MSW’s. Our competitors provided information about licensure, but they did not provide a list of schools in a way that provided value to users.</p>

<h2>Define and Ideate</h2>
<p>I did not conduct user research specific to social work degrees due to limited time and resources. However, to keep our project moving, I drew from existing qualitative data from the <a href="https://www.cswe.org/CSWE/media/Workforce-Study/2018-Social-Work-Workforce-Report-Final.pdf">2018 CSWE study</a> as well as from internal data from people who searched for online schools to understand our audience.</p>


<p>Prospective students are interested in:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Cost (affordability)</li>
  <li>Expected Salary in the field</li>
  <li>How the school/program will help them enter the field or progress their careers</li>
</ol>

<p>The goal became to provide credible rankings of schools for BSWs, MSWs based on best value and affordability, and also provide comprehensive lists of schools for those degrees. It would serve as a tool/resource for users to select a school that will meet their needs as a prospective student of social work.</p>

<h2>Product Road Map and MVP</h2>
<p>In order to focus on and figure out what my MVP is, I listed out features and prioritized them using a product roadmap, considering the ROI by weighing impact and cost. Although my original plan was to include a job board for social work careers, I removed it from the MVP because of time limitation and engineer bandwidth to build it out and created general content about careers instead.</p>

<p>I decided to prioritize the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create Best and Most Affordable BSW and MSW ranking lists for online programs, campus programs, and by state.</li>
<li>Create content about social work licensure, programs, and careers</li>
</ol>

<h2>Information Architecture - Site Map</h2>
<p>To determine the site architecture, I conducted a card sorting activity with colleagues who were not involved with this project. I had been struggling with organizing the navigation so that was not overwhelming, or confusing, repetitive, but the results showed a clear pattern that allowed us to organize the navigation clearly. Common sortings were to separate online from on-campus degrees and to group state pages together.</p>

<p>I detailed the information architecture below:</p>

  <div class="col-md-12 p-2 text-center">
          <img class="casestudy" src="/img/swd-site-architecture.png" alt="site architecture with groups: Online BSW, BSW, By State, Online MSW, MSW, and About.">
  </div>
</div>

<h2>Design - Wireframes</h2>
<p>I organized the content into pages to create various iterations for wireframe and consulted with the Designers.</p>
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-6 p-2 text-center">
          <img class="casestudy-img" src="/img/swd-wf-hp.png" alt="wireframe of socialworkdegree.org homepage">
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-6 p-2 text-center">
          <img class="casestudy-img" src="/img/swd-wf-state-hub.png" alt="wireframe of socialworkdegree.org states hub">
  </div>
</div>


<h2>Design - Mocks</h2>

<p>I collaborated with the Designers to choose the color scheme and to design the logo, and they put it all together to develop high-fidelity mocks.</p>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-6 p-2 text-center">
          <img class="casestudy-img" src="/img/swd-desktop-mock.png" alt="mock of socialworkdegree.org homepage on desktop">
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-6 p-2 text-center">
          <img class="casestudy-img" src="/img/swd-mobile-mock.png" alt="mock of socialworkdegree.org homepage on iphone">
  </div>
</div>

<h1 class="casestudy">Final Product</h1>
  <p>I built SocialWorkDegree.org using HTML and CSS, with the help of the engineering team to build the backend. By the end, I created a website with rankings and content about online and campus-based social work degree programs as well as more career-oriented content about licensure and career paths.</p>

<h2>Success Metrics</h2>
  <p>We can measure success in the following ways:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Conversion Rate for our Find a Degree Tool</li>
    <li>Number of visitors and average bounce rate</li>
    <li>SERP ranking positions</li>
  </ul>
